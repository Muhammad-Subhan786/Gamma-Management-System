# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## üîç **Current Issue**
Your Vercel deployment is not connecting to your Railway backend, causing:
- "Employee ID not found" errors on Vercel
- Different data between Vercel and Railway deployments

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solution: Connect Vercel to Railway Backend**

### **Step 1: Get Your Railway Backend URL**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Find your deployed app
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variable in Vercel**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Add a new variable:
   - **Name**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development
5. Click **Save**

### **Step 3: Redeploy**
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Wait for the build to complete

### **Step 4: Test**
1. Try the same employee ID on both URLs
2. Both should now show the same data

## üîß **Alternative: Deploy Only Frontend to Vercel**

If you want to deploy only the frontend to Vercel:

### **Step 1: Create Frontend-Only Repository**
```bash
# Create a new repo for frontend only
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo
cd your-frontend-repo

# Copy only the client folder
cp -r ../Emp/client/* .

# Update package.json to remove backend dependencies
# Remove server-related scripts and dependencies
```

### **Step 2: Update API Configuration**
In `src/services/api.js`, ensure:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/api';
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Vercel**
1. Push to your frontend-only repository
2. Connect to Vercel
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy

## üåê **Final URLs**
- **Railway (Full-stack)**: `https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app`
- **Vercel (Frontend only)**: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`

Both will use the same Railway backend and database.

## ‚úÖ **Expected Result**
After fixing:
- Same employee ID works on both URLs
- Same data appears on both deployments
- Consistent user experience across platforms
